			<h1>The North Florida Brain Bee</h1>

			<h4>Presented by the Neuroscience Program at Florida State University</h4>

			<h3>What is the Brain Bee?</h3>

			<p>The Annual North Florida Brain Bee is a live Q & A competition that tests the neuroscience knowledge of high school students. Young men and women compete to determine who is the "best brain" on such topics as intelligence, learning and memory, emotions, sensations, movement, stress, aging, sleep, addiction, neuroanatomy and neural disorders. Participants can study this material by using "Brain Facts" published by the Society for Neuroscience.</p>

			<p>The winner of the North Florida Brain Bee competition travels to the National Brain Bee Competition in Baltimore, Maryland. The FSU Program in Neuroscience will fund travel expenses, lodging, food, and local transportation for the winner and a chaperone. In addition, the top 3 place winners will be awarded with a cash prize. All participants will receive a certificate and t-shirt.</p>

			<p>The winner of the National Brain Competition in Baltimore, Maryland will travel to attend the International Brain Bee (IBB) competition. The IBB winner will receive $3000, an individual trophy, a traveling trophy for their high school, and a fellowship to work in the laboratory of a neuroscientist during the summer. There will also be prizes for second and third place winners.</p>

			<h4>FSU Neuroscience Study Program</h4>

			<p>In preparation for Annual North Florida Brain Bees, the Neuroscience Program at Florida State University host a FREE Preparatory and Review Lecture Series for all high school students interested in participating in the Brain Bee. The review sessions will be held weekly on the FSU campus and will include instruction on and review of material that will be covered during the Brain Bee.</p>

			<p>All high school students are welcome to attend the Neuroscience Study Lectures which are held every Friday in the fall semester from 5-7pm in the psychology building. Weekly lecture topics and updates are posted to our <%= link_to 'Facebook page', 'https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=fsu%20neuroscience%20outreach', :target => "_blank" %>. For more information, please contact <%= link_to 'Lindsay Elvir', '/grad/lelvir' %>.</p>

			<h4>Fall Classroom Visits</h4>

			<p>Each September and October, graduate students from the Neuroscience Program and other programs in Psychology, Biology, and the College of Medicine at FSU visit local Big Bend high schools to promote brain and neuroscience knowledge.  They will also provide information regarding the Annual North Florida Brain Bee and hand out a FREE Neuroscience Study Program.</p>
